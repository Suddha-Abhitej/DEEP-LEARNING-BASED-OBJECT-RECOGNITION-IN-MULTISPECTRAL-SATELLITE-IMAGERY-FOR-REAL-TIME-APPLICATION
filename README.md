# DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-OBJECT-RECOGNITION-IN-MULTISPECTRAL-SATELLITE-IMAGERY-FOR-REAL-TIME-APPLICATION

OBJECTIVE :
The primary goal of our project is to develop the most effective model for
recognizing satellite images. Our technologies, we feel, offer the highest accuracy
and may be employed in a variety of real-time applications (Land cover
classification). There are several platforms that would be interested in this approach,
which would allow them to detect and recognize various land coverings without the
need for human participation.
Here we try to propose different CNN models such as 
# VGG16,VGG19,Resnet50,Resnet50V2
